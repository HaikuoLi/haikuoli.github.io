<strong>FIRST-YEAR ROTATION PROJECTS</strong><br>
At least three rotations are required for WashU DBBS students before choosing a thesis lab:<br><br>
<strong>Understanding the intracellular effects of Cationic Amphipathic Drugs on organelles</strong><br>
Rotation at <a href="http://www.dbbs.wustl.edu/faculty/Pages/faculty_bio.aspx?SID=6646">Peterson Lab</a>, 8/2019-11/2019<br>
<i>Brief Description: </i>Cationic Amphipathic Drugs are utilized in various clinical applications, 
  but their underlying intracellular mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that due to different drug treatments, 
  there could be different changes of morphology or abundance of multiple organelles, ultimately contributing to distinct mechanisms of cell death. 
  In this rotation, I successfully completed the imaging tests to investigate the intracellular drug effects.<br><br>

  
<strong>Studying the tumor heterogeneity of head and neck cancer by single-cell RNA sequencing</strong><br>
Rotation at <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/faculty/Pages/faculty_bio.aspx?SID=6785">Puram Lab</a>, 11/2019-1/2020<br>
<i>Brief Description: </i>In this rotation, I focused on a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method named cell hashing. By multiplexing different cell lines with unique antibody barcodes, cell hashing enables us to reduce the routine cost of scRNA-seq, decrease the technology-dependent batch effects, and largely exclude potential multilet signals in scRNA-seq. I successfully performed cell hashing on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines which generated a series of datasets with promising data quality. 
  Besides, I also participated another project on functional validations of potential Epithelialâ€“Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-driving transcriptional factors of HNSCC.
