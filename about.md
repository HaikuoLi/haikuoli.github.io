<strong>My Background</strong><br>
  My name is Haikuo Li (李海廓). I was born in Linyi, Shandong Province, China in 1997 and lived there before my undergraduate life.<br><br>
  
  In high school, I was most interested in mathematics and won the Bronze Medal in the Chinese Mathematics Olympics. At that point, I learned that biology had entered a big data era and required multidisciplinary approaches such as mathematical modelling and statistics to solve cutting-edge genomic problems. Therefore, I chose bioscience as my undergraduate major at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). At SJTU, I was mainly trained in biochemistry and systems biology and led a first-author project in which we identified biomarkers for lymphoma patients with mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In my 4th year, I worked as a visiting undergraduate researcher at Yale University Department of Immunobiology to broaden my knowledge in immunology. I was awarded Shanghai Excellent Graduate in Bachelor Degree.<br><br>
  
  I started my PhD study at Washington University in St. Louis in 2019. At WashU DBBS, I matriculated in the Program in Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology with my background in proteomics. During my first-year PhD training at WashU, I learned that advances in single-cell genomics improved our understanding of tissue heterogeneity and underlying cellular events in disease, and therefore, I transferred to the Program in Molecular Genetics and Genomics with huge passion in using single-cell technologies to better precision medicine. After joining the Humphreys Lab at WashU, I have developed deep expertise in both wet-lab (single-cell library generation, technology development, mouse surgery, tissue culture, microscope imaging etc.) and dry-lab skills (single-cell data preprocessing, analysis, visualization and computational modelling), and have completed several first author research and review articles on single-cell technology development and applications. My thesis projects aim to identify kidney metabolic heterogeneity and decipher cellular events that drive kidney fibrosis with high-throughput single-cell multiomics approaches. We specifically selected single-cell combinatorial indexing (sci) as the platform, leveraging its unique advantage in ultra-high throughput, sample multiplexing capacity and low costs. The ultimate goal is to identify potential therapeutic targets that can be used to ameliorate kidney disease progression. I obtained my Ph.D in 12/2023.<br>
