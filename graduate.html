<strong>Dressing Up for the Regulators: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may window-dress to supervisors.  For empirical identification, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers.  After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease the share of riskier securities and loans, and level of overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit.  Effects are stronger for banks with higher trading expertise.  Results suggest banks’ window-dressing for supervisory audits, especially on liquid securities that are easier to trade, and hold important implications for supervision.</p><br>

At least three rotations are required for WashU DBBS students before choosing a thesis lab.<br>
<strong>Understanding the intracellular effects of Cationic Amphipathic Drugs on organelles</strong><br>
at <a href="http://www.dbbs.wustl.edu/faculty/Pages/faculty_bio.aspx?SID=6646">Peterson Lab</a>, 8/2019-11/2019<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Brief Description: </i>Cationic Amphipathic Drugs are utilized in various clinical applications, 
  but their underlying intracellular mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that due to different drug treatments, 
  there could be different changes of morphology or abundance of multiple organelles, ultimately contributing to distinct mechanisms of autophagy. 
  In this rotation, I successfully completed the imaging tests to investigate the intracellular drug effects.</p><br>
