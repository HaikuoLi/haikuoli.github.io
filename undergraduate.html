<strong>Clinical Proteomics Analysis using Data Independent Acquisition-Mass Spectrometry Identified Classifiers for Molecular Characterization of Lymphoma</strong><br>
Undergraduate Research Fellow, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-yan-5794922/">Yan Lab</a>, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 9/2016-7/2018<br><br>
  
<i>Summary:</i> We performed a biomarker-discovery proteomics study on lymphoma by utilizing quantitative tandem mass spectrometry technology. I led this project as the first author.<br>
<i>Research Description:</i> 
Development of molecular classifiers of lymphoma will provide potential biomarkers for studying the pathogenesis of lymphoma and a complementary tool for accurate clinical diagnosis and precision medicine practice. In this study, we conducted a proteomics analysis via Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry method on 109 lymph node samples from clinical patients, covering a comprehensive suite of lymphoma subtypes including B-NHL, T-NHL, HL, Lymphadenitis, Tumor metastatic lymph node, and Non-neoplastic lymph node. We generated a lymphoma-associated proteomic profiling data resource, quantified and validated significant classifiers of different disease subgroups, and provided classifiers correlating with the aggressive and prognostic characteristics of lymphoma. <br><br>

<strong>Dressing Up for the Regulators: Evidence from the Largest-Ever Supervisory Review</strong><br>with Puriya Abbassi, Rajkamal Iyer and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Government regulation requires effective supervision, but regulated entities may window-dress to supervisors.  For empirical identification, we analyze banks exploiting a quasi-natural experiment —ECB’s 2014 asset quality review (AQR)— in conjunction with the security and credit registers.  After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks decrease the share of riskier securities and loans, and level of overall securities and credit supply. After AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities, but not riskier credit.  Effects are stronger for banks with higher trading expertise.  Results suggest banks’ window-dressing for supervisory audits, especially on liquid securities that are easier to trade, and hold important implications for supervision.</p><br>
