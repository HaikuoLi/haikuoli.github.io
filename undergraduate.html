I started my undergraduate research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in my sophomore year. I completed my thesis research at Yale University in my senior year.<br><br>
  
<strong>Clinical Proteomics Analysis using Data Independent Acquisition-Mass Spectrometry Identified Classifiers for Molecular Characterization of Lymphoma</strong><br>
Undergraduate Research Fellow, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-yan-5794922/">Yan Lab</a>, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 9/2016-7/2018<br><br>
  
<i>Summary:</i> We performed a biomarker-discovery proteomics study on lymphoma by utilizing quantitative tandem mass spectrometry technology. I led this project as the <strong>first author</strong> (Prepared to submit).<br><br>
<i>Research Description:</i> 
Development of molecular classifiers of lymphoma will provide potential biomarkers for studying the pathogenesis of lymphoma and a complementary tool for accurate clinical diagnosis and precision medicine practice. In this study, we conducted a proteomics analysis via Data Independent Acquisition mass spectrometry method on 109 lymph node samples from clinical patients, covering a comprehensive suite of lymphoma subtypes including B-NHL, T-NHL, HL, Lymphadenitis, Tumor metastatic lymph node, and Non-neoplastic lymph node. We generated a lymphoma-associated proteomic profiling data resource, quantified and validated significant classifiers of different disease subgroups, and provided classifiers correlating with the aggressive and prognostic characteristics of lymphoma. <br><br>

<strong>Modulating the Tumor-targeting Specificity of DR-18 by Protein Engineering</strong><br>
Visiting Undergraduate, <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/bbs/profile/aaron_ring/">Ring Lab</a>, Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 7/2018-4/2019<br><br>
  
<i>Summary:</i> This is my independent thesis research, in which we aimed to further improve the tumor-targeting specificity of a popular variant of Interleukin-18 (IL-18), balancing its therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity. See my dissertation <a href="http://sjcg.jwc.sjtu.edu.cn/363/3/3/Dissertation.html">here</a>.<br><br>
<i>Research Description:</i> 
Here, we proposed two assays, pro-peptide assay and pH-sensitive assay: the former assay leveraged the unique property of IL-18 that processing of its precursor peptide is required for its maturation. The latter assay harnessed the extracellular acidity of tumor and aimed to construct a low-pH favorable variant. Both assays were developed and evaluated in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.<br><br>
