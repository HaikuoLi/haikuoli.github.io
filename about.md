<strong>My Background</strong><br>
I was born in Linyi, Shandong Province, China in 1997 and lived there before my undergraduate life. In high shcool, I was most interested in mathematics and won the top 7 students out of >100,000 in the Chinese Mathematics Olympics in 2014. Therefore, I successfully received admission offers from several top Chinese universities pushing me to continue my mathematics study.<br>
However, at that point, driven by the enthusiasm and curiosity about life science from deep in my heart, I made an entirely distinct decision that I chose Shanghai Jiao Tong University for my undergraduate study, which allowed me to enter their Honors Program in Bioscience (Top 0.1% in 2015 Chinese University Entrance Examination: 681 points). I was mainly trained in systems biology, immunology, and evolutionary biology in my undergraduate. I also served as the Presidium of Students Union of my college for one year. I was awarded Shanghai Excellent Graduate in Bachelor Degree in 2019.<br>
After interviewed by several top graduate schools in the United States including WashU, Harvard, and Yale, I started my graduate study at WashU since 2019.<br><br>

<strong>My Hobby</strong><br>
I loved basketball in my childhood due to the influence of Yao Ming, the most successful Chinese player in NBA, and played in the basketball team of my high school for a short period. Now I am a soccer fan of Shandong Luneng FC.<br>
I loved reading and writing Chinese prose/poetry, cooking, and watching Naruto anime in my spare time.<br><br>
