<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome! My name is Haikuo Li. I am a Ph.D. student in Bioscience at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.<br>
As a first-year student in the Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences (Program in <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/genetics/Pages/default.aspx">Molecular Genetics and Genomics</a>), I am currently rotating in the lab of Prof. Sid Puram studying tumor heterogeneity using single-cell RNA sequencing.
See <a href="https://haikuoli.github.io/graduate/">Graduate</a> to learn more about my graduate studies.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">I got my Bachelor of Science Degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (<a href="https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/">Bioscience, Zhiyuan Honors Program</a>) in 2019.
  At Shanghai Center for Systems Biology, I led a proteomic project on identification of lymphoma classifiers via mass spectrometry.<br>
Moreover, I spent my fourth year as a visiting student at Yale University Department of Immunobiology. 
We used protein engineering to modulate the immunotherapeutic efficacy of Interleukin-18 by protein engineering.
