<strong>My Background</strong><br>
My name is Haikuo Li (李海廓). I was born in Linyi, Shandong Province, China in 1997 and lived there before my undergraduate life. In high shcool, I was most interested in mathematics and won the top 7 students out of >100,000 in the Chinese Mathematics Olympics in 2014.<br>
At that point, driven by the enthusiasm and curiosity about life science from deep in my heart, I chose Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) for my undergraduate study, which allowed me to enter their Honors Program in Bioscience (Top 0.1% in 2015 Chinese University Entrance Examination: 681 points). I was mainly trained in systems biology, immunology, and evolutionary biology in my undergraduate. I also served as the Presidium of Students Union of my college for one year. I was awarded Shanghai Excellent Graduate in Bachelor Degree in 2019.<br>
After interviewed by several top Ph.D. programs in the United States including WashU, Harvard, and Yale, I started my graduate study at WashU since 2019.<br><br>
