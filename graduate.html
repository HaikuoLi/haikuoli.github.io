<strong>FIRST-YEAR ROTATION PROJECTS</strong><br>
At least three rotations are required for WashU DBBS students before choosing a thesis lab:<br><br>
<strong>Understanding the intracellular effects of Cationic Amphipathic Drugs on organelles</strong><br>
Rotation at <a href="http://www.dbbs.wustl.edu/faculty/Pages/faculty_bio.aspx?SID=6646">Peterson Lab</a>, 8/2019-11/2019<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Brief Description: </i>Cationic Amphipathic Drugs are utilized in various clinical applications, 
  but their underlying intracellular mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that due to different drug treatments, 
  there could be different changes of morphology or abundance of multiple organelles, ultimately contributing to distinct mechanisms of autophagy. 
  In this rotation, I successfully completed the imaging tests to investigate the intracellular drug effects.<br>

<strong>Studying tumor heterogeneity by single-cell RNA sequencing and transcription characterization</strong><br>
Rotation at <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/faculty/Pages/faculty_bio.aspx?SID=6785">Puram Lab</a>, 11/2019-1/2020<br>
