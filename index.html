Welcome! My name is Haikuo Li. I am a Ph.D. student in Bioscience at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.
  As a first-year student in the Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences, I am currently rotating in the lab of Prof. Sid Puram studying tumor heterogeneity using single-cell RNA sequencing.
  See <a href="https://haikuoli.github.io/graduate/">Graduate</a> to learn more about my graduate studies.

<br><br>
I got my Bachelor of Science Degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Bioscience, Zhiyuan Honors Program) in 2019.
  There I led a proteomic project on identification of lymphoma classifiers via mass spectrometry.
  Moreover, I spent my fourth year as a visiting student at Yale University Department of Immunobiology, 
  focusing on modulating the immunotherapeutic efficacy of IL-18 by protein engineering.
