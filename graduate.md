My graduate research focuses on investigating molecular mechanisms underlying tissue fibrogenesis with large-scale single-cell multiomics, under the mentorship of Dr. Benjiamin Humphreys. By leveraging a novel single-cell profiling methodology called split-pool barcoding, we are studying novel cellular states responsible for tissue injury and repair and identifying potential therapeutic targets.<br><br>

<strong>MILESTONES</strong><br>
I was trained by <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/biophysics/Pages/BBSB.aspx">Biochemistry, Biophysics & Structural Biology Program</a> in the first semester in 2019. I developed my research interests in single-cell studies and joined <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/genetics/Pages/default.aspx">Molecular Genetics and Genomics Program</a> since 2020. I officialy joined Humphreys Lab in June 2020. I passed the qualifying exam in Sept 2020 by proposing a project related to kidney fibrosis and myofibroblast biology. My thesis project was proposed in August 2021.<br><br>
