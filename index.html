<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome! My name is <strong>Haikuo Li</strong>. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.fan-lab.org/">Rong Fan Laboratory</a> at Yale University.<br>
  
  I got my Ph.D. in Biology & Biomedical Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis (Program in Molecular Genetics and Genomics).
  At WashU, I worked in the Humphreys Lab studying mechanisms of kidney injury and fibrosis with single-cell technologies.
  See <a href="https://haikuoli.github.io/graduate/">Thesis Work</a> to learn more about my graduate studies.<br><br>
  
<strong>Research Interests</strong>:<br>
  Single-cell genomics; spatial multiomics; systems biology; tissue fibrosis & regeneration; metabolisms; translational medicine; cancer<br>
